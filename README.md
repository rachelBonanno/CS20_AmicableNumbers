Identify three differences and three similarities between C++ and Javascript.
DIFFERENCES:

   to declare each variable type using specifications just as int or float.
2. JavaScript is a high-level language while C++ is a low-level language.

What is your opinion of Javascript as a programming language?
It is used a lot in the workforce and is really useful to have ibn your tool 
box of programming languages. I have nothing against it. It is relatively 
strait forward.
